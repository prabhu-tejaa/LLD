Dependency Inversion Principle:

High level module should not depend on low level model but rather both should depend on abstraction.

ex:

application is a high level module
Sql is a low level module

instead of having direct connection to low and high level modules, have an interface between them to communicate between each other.

"High level module - interface - low level module"


If open close principle is the target then Dependency Inversion Principle is the solution.
