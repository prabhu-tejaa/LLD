what is LLD?

LLD - Low Level Design

LLD focuses on:
                - Scalability
                - Maintainability (old code should not be broken / easily debuggable)
                - Reusability (should not be tightly coupled)

What is not LLD?
HLD: High Level Design
        - Tech stack (Java / spring boot)
        - Which Data base ( SQL / NOSQL)
        - Server scaling
        - Cost optimization

HLD has almost no code in the interviews.

HLD - LLD - DSA, using these 3 we make an application

HLD focuses on System architecture
LLD focuses on code structure
DSA is to tool used by LLD to solve the problems

** DSA is the brain of an application
LLD is the skeleton **
