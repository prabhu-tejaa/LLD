Open Close Principle:

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Closed for modification: You should not change existing code when requirements change.

Open for extension: You should be able to add new behavior by adding new code (like new classes or methods), not by changing old code.

Existing code should remain untouched.
New features or changes should be made by extending the code, not editing it.
