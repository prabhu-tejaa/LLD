Sequence diagram:

Most of the time this is not asked in the interviews.

but for certain cases we should know hoe sequence diagram works.

sequence diagram is a type of behavioural digram, interaction between 2 classes (how and when)

Communication/interaction between 2 classes.

In this we represent class with just a small box [A] [B]

Different terms in sequence diagram:

1. LifeLine:

It shows how long it any object exists.

any object, class, component - when and all it exists

ex:
take 2 objects

A and B

it is repressed by:
|
|
|
|

2. Activation bar:
it is represented by box []

It shows how long it any object will be active.



The way we send messages in this diagram?

There are 2 ways we send diagram:
1. Asynchronous
2. Synchronous

1. Asynchronous:
You keep sending messages, you dont wait for the response

Its represented using closed arrow.

2. Synchronous:
When you send a message, you wait for its response. Until you get the response, you dont send another message

Its represented using open arrow.


There are 2 types of Messages:

1. Create Message
2. Destroy Message

Another type of message:

1. Lost Message
2. Found Message

1. Lost Message:

Lost message is nothing but, imagine an object has to receive a message but its activation time has been done before it reached to this message. This is called lost message

It is represented by circle and a dot inside (.)

2. Found Message

here we get a message from a source which we dont know where's its coming from, an unknown message is found.

Imagine Object A got a random message and there's nobody to respond to

How to draw sequence diagram?

use-case:

Imagine a user going to atm, putting their card, pin, amount and doing a withdrawal transaction. Now lets do the sequence diagram for this.

always remember while creating a sequence diagram, we should have these 3 things

1. use-case
2. Identify Objects
3. Draw sequence diagram


Terms in sequence diagram:

alt = denotes if-else
option = if condition
loop: for loops
